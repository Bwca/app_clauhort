 * here, rather than a fixed `\w+` character class, is what makes a name
 * containing a hyphen (or any other non-word character) mentionable at all.

 * captured "TP", matched no agent, and silently fell back to a broadcast —

 * skills its own live process reported having (getAgentSkills in
 * agentProcessManager.js — populated from the CLI's own `skills` list on
 * its `system/init` event). Returns null for anything else (normal chat),
 * including a mention followed by ordinary text that merely contains a "/",
 * AND a syntactically-valid "@Name /word" whose word isn't a real command.
 *
 * That last case matters more than it looks: `newMessage.content` for a
 * genuine skill invocation is sent to the CLI as a BARE "/word" string, with
 * no "@Name " prefix — and the `claude` CLI recognizes ITS OWN built-in
 * local commands (e.g. "/chrome", "/help", "/clear" — an entirely different,
 * larger set than this project's custom commands, and NOT the same list as
 * `skills` above — confirmed those meta-commands are absent from `skills`)
 * by that same bare-leading-slash syntax. Confirmed live: sending
 * "@SomeAgent /chrome" against an agent with no "/chrome" custom command got
 * the CLI's own local-command dispatcher to intercept it —
 * {"type":"system","subtype":"local_command"} in the session transcript —
 * before the model ever saw the turn, silently discarding the [System]
 * preamble sent alongside it in the same turn (see buildPromptBlocks in
 * ws/handler.js). Since that preamble only ever goes out once per agent per
 * chat, the agent's identity was lost for good the moment its first-ever
 * message happened to collide with a CLI-native command name. Validating
 * against the real command/skill list closes this: anything that isn't an
 * actual registered skill now falls through to parseResponders as ordinary
 * chat text (content kept intact, "@Name " prefix included), which doesn't
 * match the CLI's bare-slash trigger.

 * @param {string} content - Raw message content from the user
