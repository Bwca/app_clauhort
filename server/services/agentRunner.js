 *
 * Actually talking to `claude` (spawning, keeping a process alive across
 * turns, stream-json parsing) lives in agentProcessManager.js — every
 * agent gets ONE persistent process for as long as it's in a chat, instead
 * of a fresh one-shot process per turn, so MCP servers (and anything else
 * expensive to establish) survive across turns rather than being torn down
 * and reconnected on every single message. runAgentStream below just
 * delegates to it, keeping its own external contract unchanged so callers
 * don't need to know or care.

 * Derives the scoped `--allowedTools` pattern(s) to grant for a denied,
 * non-file-path tool call. Called server-side (handler.js's GRANT_PERMISSION
 * handler) on the same flattened "value" string the permission card already
 * displays — the client never needs to know about tool-pattern syntax.
 *
 * For Bash: acceptEdits denies a chained command (`a && b`, `a; b`, `a | b`)
 * outright as "multiple operations" — the denial's tool_input.command is the
 * FULL chained string, not just whichever sub-command actually needed
 * approval. Granting only a pattern derived from the first sub-command would
 * silently fail to unblock a later sub-command that isn't first in the chain
 * (this was caught by this feature's own regression test). So: split on
 * shell chaining operators and derive one pattern per sub-command, each as
 * its first two whitespace-separated tokens (e.g. "git add ..." -> "Bash(git
 * add:*)"), confirmed empirically against the real `claude` CLI (v2.1.220).
 * Two tokens rather than one keeps a grant from silently covering an entire
 * tool (granting "git add" must never also authorize "git push --force") —
 * granting every sub-command of a chain the user explicitly saw and approved
 * is correct, since that's exactly what the permission card displayed.
 *
 * For any other non-file tool (WebFetch, WebSearch, Task, ...), Claude Code's
 * permission patterns don't support this kind of sub-command scoping — the
 * bare tool name is the only granted form.
 * @param {string} toolName
 * @param {string} value - The denial's flattened display value (a Bash
 *   command string, or JSON.stringify(tool_input) for anything else)

/**
 * Narrows a turn's raw permission_denials down to genuinely distinct asks.

 * standalone "npm --version", or a piped "cmd | tail -60" then the same
 * command unpiped. Both members of each pair were reported by a user as
 * confusing "duplicate" permission rows: granting the first already covers
 * the second via deriveToolPatterns, so asking for it again is pure
 * redundancy, not a genuinely separate authorization.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to Bash only. For file-path tools (Write/Edit/Read/
 * NotebookEdit), deriveToolPatterns has no real pattern to compare — it
 * just returns the bare tool name — so two DIFFERENT files would both
 * collapse to the same "pattern", which would wrongly hide a second,
 * legitimately different file's permission request. Exact tool+value
