 * sendAt has already passed is left UN-ARMED here instead of being armed
 * (which would fire it almost immediately — see armTimer's docs) or
 * deleted outright (an earlier version of this function did that). A
 * normal user-scheduled message firing late after downtime is still the

 * But an auto-continue's sendAt targets a specific session-limit reset
 * time; once the server's been down past it, that assumption is stale and
 * unverifiable, and firing it automatically risks re-triggering the exact
 * relay cascade it exists to recover from (see fix(chats) in
 * ws/handler.js's skipRelay). Silently deleting it was the old behaviour,
 * but that took the decision away from the user entirely. Instead, the row
 * is simply left in the DB with no timer: getScheduledMessages still
 * returns it, so the next time the user opens that chat the frontend's
 * stale-auto-continue banner (app.js) surfaces it and lets them fire it
 * now or discard it — see the fire-now and DELETE scheduled-message routes
 * in routes/chats.js. Reported live: exactly 3 rows sat through a ~5-hour
 * outage and would otherwise have fired immediately (or been silently
 * dropped) on the next start.
