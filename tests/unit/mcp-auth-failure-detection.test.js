/**
 * @fileoverview Unit tests for looksLikeMcpAuthFailure (server/services/agentProcessManager.js)
 * — a pure function, no `claude` subprocess involved.
 *
 * Reported live: a user re-authenticated an MCP server (Linear) via `/login`
 * in a separate real terminal, but the persistent agent process already
 * running in the chat kept failing tool calls with "Failed to authenticate:
 * OAuth session expired..." — because MCP auth is only ever read once, at
 * that process's own spawn time. This predicate is how the turn-completion
 * handler in agentProcessManager.js recognizes that failure (confirmed via
 * the installed `claude` binary's own embedded wording) and evicts the
 * process so the next turn spawns fresh and picks up the renewed auth.
